# what are modules in global apps?

## Overview
1. Freshworks offers a variety of modules, each tied to a specific Freshworks product and its functionalities.
2. Apps are built by combining various modules depending on the desired features.
3. The combination of modules determines which Freshworks products the app is compatible with and what functionalities are accessible to users with specific subscriptions.

## Examples
- **Freshdesk module:** Interacts with support tickets.
- **Freshservice module:** Manages IT assets and service requests.
- **Common module:** Can be combined with product-specific modules to build cross‑product apps.

# Types of Freshworks Modules

## Module Categories
1. **Common Module:**
   - Provides functionalities like serverless events, request templates, and SMI functions.
   - Enables app development across multiple Freshworks products.
2. **Individual Modules:**
   - Represent specific Freshworks products (e.g., Freshdesk, Freshservice, Freshsales).
   - Offer product‑related functionalities.

## Usage Scenarios
1. **App Designed for a Specific Product:**
   - If an app is primarily built for one product (e.g., Freshdesk support tickets), subscribing to that product's SKU activates all features.
2. **App with Modules Across Products:**
   - Integrating modules for different products (e.g., Freshdesk and Freshservice) means available features depend on subscriptions to each respective product.
3. **App Using the Common Module:**
   - When combined with other modules, subscription restrictions apply to both common and product‑specific functionalities.
