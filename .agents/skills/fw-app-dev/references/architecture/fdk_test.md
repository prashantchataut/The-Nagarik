# Detailed instructions for testing a global app of type frontend app

## Summary
1. **Latest Chrome Requirement:** Ensure you have the latest version of Chrome.
2. **Run FDK Command:** Execute `fdk run` to start the local test server.
3. **System Settings:** Configure testing modules and account URLs.
4. **App Settings (if applicable):** Provide installation parameters if needed.
5. **Test in Freshworks Product:** Verify app rendering and functionality.
6. **Code Coverage:** Ensure sufficient code coverage and attach logs for troubleshooting.

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Latest Chrome Requirement
- Ensure you have the latest version of Chrome installed.

### Step 2: Run FDK Command
- **Navigate:** Go to your app's directory in the command line.
- **Execute Command:** Run the command `fdk run`. This starts the local test server.
- **Result:** The test URLs for the product UI, App Settings, and serverless events simulation will be displayed.

### Step 3: System Settings
- **Access URL:** Open [http://localhost:10001/system_settings](http://localhost:10001/system_settings) in your browser.
- **Select Modules:** Choose the modules you want to test.
- **Enter URLs:** Provide valid account URLs for the corresponding products in the "Enter account URL" section. These URLs serve as the currentHost during testing.
- **Continue:** Click **Continue**.

### Step 4: App Settings (if applicable)
- **Access URL:** If your app has installation parameters, the App Settings page will open at [http://localhost:10001/custom_configs](http://localhost:10001/custom_configs).
- **Enter Parameters:** Fill in the required values and click **Install**.
- **No Parameters:** If there are no parameters, a message will indicate that the app doesn't have an installation page.

### Step 5: Test in Freshworks Product
- **Log In:** Sign in to the Freshworks account where you want to test the app.
- **Modify URL:** Append `?dev=true` to the default account URL shown in the address bar.
  _Example:_ `https://domain.myfreshworks.com/crm/sales/contacts/view/401033886912?dev=true`
- **Verify:** Navigate to the location where the app is expected to be deployed and verify that the app renders correctly while testing its functionality.

### Step 6: Code Coverage
- **Code Coverage:** Aim for at least 80% code coverage for successful publication in the Freshworks Marketplace. (See "Code coverage" for details.)
- **Support:** Attach detailed logs to your support ticket to help with faster troubleshooting in case of issues.

# Detailed instructions for testing a global app of type serverless app

## Summary
1. **Latest Chrome Requirement:** Ensure you have the latest version of Chrome.
2. **Run FDK Command:** Execute `fdk run` to start the local test server.
3. **System Settings:** Configure testing modules and account URLs.
4. **App Settings (if applicable):** Provide installation parameters if needed.
5. **Test Serverless Events:** Simulate serverless events using the test interface.
6. **Additional Notes:** Understand payload differences and test event options.

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Latest Chrome Requirement
- Ensure you have the latest version of Chrome installed.

### Step 2: Run FDK Command
- **Navigate:** Go to your app's directory in the command line.
- **Execute Command:** Run the command `fdk run`. This starts the local test server.
- **Result:** The test URLs for the product UI, App Settings, and serverless events simulation will be displayed.

### Step 3: System Settings
- **Access URL:** Open [http://localhost:10001/system_settings](http://localhost:10001/system_settings) in your browser.
- **Select Modules:** Choose the modules you want to test.
- **Enter URLs:** Provide valid account URLs for the corresponding products in the "Enter account URL" section, which act as the currentHost during testing.
- **Continue:** Click **Continue**.

### Step 4: App Settings (if applicable)
- **Access URL:** If your app has installation parameters, the App Settings page will open at [http://localhost:10001/custom_configs](http://localhost:10001/custom_configs).
- **Enter Parameters:** Fill in the required values and click **Install**.
- **No Parameters:** If there are no parameters, a message will indicate that the app doesn't have an installation page.

### Step 5: Test Serverless Events
- **Access URL:** Navigate to [http://localhost:10001/web/test](http://localhost:10001/web/test).
- **Select Options:** Choose the module and event to test from the drop-down menus.
- **Review Payload:** Examine the event payload.
- **Simulate:** Click **Simulate**.
  - **On Success:** The button changes to "Success" and the payload is added to the test data folder.
  - **On Failure:** The button changes to "Failed", allowing you to modify the payload and retry.

### Step 6: Additional Notes
- **Payload Details:** The test data payloads in `server/test_data` do not include the `currentHost` attribute that is present in actual runtime payloads; during testing, system settings selections serve as the currentHost.
- **Event Options:** Use the drop-down options to test various events including app setup events (`onAppInstall`, `afterAppUpdate`, `onAppUninstall`), external events (`onExternalEvent`), scheduled events (`onScheduledEvent`), and product-specific events.
