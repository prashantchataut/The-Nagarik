# What is the interface method? What are the common interface actions that an app can perform

Interface-methods is a mechanism that the developer platform provides, to enable your app to trigger certain actions on the Freshdesk UI. Using interface methods an app can, on the Freshdesk UI :
1. Display certain UI elements such as Modals, Dialog boxes, Confirmation boxes, and Notifications.
2. Mimic click actions - such as starting or stopping a timer or navigating to specific pages.
3. Show/Hide certain fields, field values, and elements (such as icons or other relevant information).
4. Enable/Disable certain buttons.
5. Set the values of certain fields.

# What interfaces can an app display/hide on the product UI

The following interfaces can be displayed/hidden on the product UI:
1. Display modals or dialog boxes - showModal method and showDialog method
2. Display confirmation messages - showConfirm method
3. Display notifications - showNotify method
4. Display or hide CTI dialler
5. Display or hide missed calls in the CTI widget

>title: How to display modals or dialog boxes
>tags: interface-method

>code:

# How to display modals or dialog boxes

1. From your project’s root, navigate to the app directory and create a <modal or dialog or any-reasonable-name>.html file. In this file, enter the code to render the (front-end of the) Modal or Dialog box.
2. Navigate to the app.js file. Subscribe to the app.initialized event, through an event listener. When the app is initialized, the parent application (the product on which the app is deployed) passes a client reference to the app.
3. After app initialization, to display a Modal or Dialog box, use the following method:
```js
client.interface.trigger("<method-name>", {
  title: "<Dialog box name>",
  template: "<path to the dialog.html file>"
})
```
<method-name> is showModal or showDialog based on the use case

Considerations while using display modals or dialog boxes
1. title is optional. Max characters: 30; value is truncated beyond 30. Default value: Modal dialog.
2. template is mandatory. Specify the path to the HTML file where the code to render the modal’s front-end is present. If no value is specified, an error message is displayed at run time.

---

>title: When should I use showModal
>tags: interface-method
>context: app.js
>code:

# When should I use showModal

The method displays a Modal in an IFrame. Events methods and Interface methods are not supported in a Modal - your app cannot react to click, change, or update events that occur inside a Modal and your app cannot trigger actions on the product UI from the Modal. Installation parameters, Request method, Data method, and Data storage are supported in modals. If your app uses these methods from modals, in the modal.html file (or in any other equivalent file that you have added), ensure to include the following appclient resource.
```js
<script src="{{{appclient}}}"></script>
```
Here is sample code to display the modal interface :
```js
try {
  let data = client.interface.trigger('showModal', {
  title: 'Sample App Form',
  backdrop: true,
  template: './views/modal.html' });
  console.log(data); // success message
} catch (error) {
    // failure operation
  console.error(error);
}
```
You can retrieve the contextual information pertaining to the parent location from where a modal is triggered by using Instance method - Context. You can use the Instance methods - Send and Receive to enable communication between modals and any other app instance.

# How to display modals without background

The modal without backdrop is a beta feature and not available for all Freshdesk accounts.

## Sample code to create a default modal without backdrop:
```js
try {
  let data = client.interface.trigger('showModal', {
  title: 'Sample App Form',
  nobackdrop: true,
  template: './views/modal.html' });
  console.log(data); // success message
} catch (error) {
    // failure operation
  console.error(error);
}
```
Considerations while creating a modal without a background
1. nobackdrop is optional. To display a modal without a backdrop, specify the nobackdrop attribute value as true. A modal with a backdrop is displayed if no value is specified for the nobackdrop attribute or if the value is specified as false. The modal without backdrop is only supported for the ticket_sidebar, ticket_requester_info, ticket_top_navigation placeholders.
2. The modal without backdrop can also be customised with background colors and linked texts. For the displaying linked text in the modal, both linkText and linkUrl attributes should be defined.
3. You can retrieve the contextual information pertaining to the parent location from where a modal is triggered by using Instance method - Context. You can use the Instance methods - Send and Receive to enable communication between modals and any other app instance.
